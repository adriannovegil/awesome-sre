# Awesome SRE [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

You want your computer systems to run well, and the subjective definition of what well means depends on the nature of the system and your goals regarding it.

Most of the time, the primary motivation for companies is to create profit for the owners and shareholders.

The definition of running well will therefore be a derivative of the business model objectives.
